# Data persistence

- still using `projects/books` for this (!!)

# App Component

- `editBookById`
- `deleteBookById`
- `createBook`

- they all change our `books` state...

# State (!!!!)

- it gets refreshed whenver a user refreshes the application!
- we'll fix this by using an API server + db (!!)
