# Accordion

- you can click each part of an accordion and it will drop down and display more text
- only one box can be open at a time
- hardcoding text inside an accordion is probably a bad idea (!!)

# Structure of Accordion

- make one Accordion component
- customize the component over time (props)
- App > Accordion
  - props: items: [ {label: "", content: ""}, {...} ]
