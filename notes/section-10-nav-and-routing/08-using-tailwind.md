# Using Tailwind

- for every element we want to decide what rule we want to add
  - border, background, color, etc.
- go to tailwindcss docs tailwindcss.com/docs
- Control+K (joke) (i.e. lots of searching)
- Search for your styling rule
- Add appropriate classname to your elements

`bg` stands for background!
`text` for text color...
(`bg-blue-500`)(`text-blue-500`)

- darkness of controllers is controlled by the number (darker = higher number)

Browsers by default apply some styling, that's why a button looks like a button, input looks like an input, etc.
