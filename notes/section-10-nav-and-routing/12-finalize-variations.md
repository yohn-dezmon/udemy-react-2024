Rounding corners:

- can be done with a "border radius"
- search tailwind docs for "border radius"
- we want "rounded-full"

White background:

- search "Background color"
- use "bg-white"

tailwind classname hierarchy:

- if you have conflicting classnames, e.g. `bg-blue` and then later `bg-white`, the later classname takes precedence.
