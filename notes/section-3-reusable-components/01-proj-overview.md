# Project overview

- we're going to create a webpage that allows users to pick from 1 of 3 AI voice chat assistants
- "personal-digital-assistants" -- the project will be called `pdas/`
- each card looks similar, but the image and text is different
  - when you see things that look identical, you can probably create a component for it (!!)
- we'll create a `ProfileCard` component
  - we'll reuse it multiple times in the `App`'s JSX

# Component Hierarchy

- you can create a diagram of the hierarchy of the components in your application
- useful to understand the relationship between components
