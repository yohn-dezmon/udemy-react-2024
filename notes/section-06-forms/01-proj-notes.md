This project was created with Vite.

- you have to download the zip file
- this will be used in sections 6-9
- download it, unzip, then `cd books` and run `npm install`

Note - The course videos used Create React App which is no longer functional to generate projects. Since the starter files use Vite there is one minor difference in that the:

- index.html is located outside of the public directory at the root of the project. This

will have no effect on the functionality of your project or the ability to follow along properly.

- they can edit the books, or delete the books
