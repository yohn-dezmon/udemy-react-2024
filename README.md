# Udemy Modern React with Redux Course

My notes and exercises from the Udemy course created by Stephen Grider.

# Creating a new react project with NodeJS

To create a new react project:
`npx create-react-app <project name>`

# Starting up a react app

```bash
cd proj/
npm start
```

Go to `localhost:3000`  
to stop: `CTRL+C`

# Directories

`jsx/` -- this folder contains the code/notes from section-1 and section-2 of the course. This was crated with `npx create-react-app jsx`.
