# Creating Content with JSX

- we are using the `jsx/` react project created in section-1

# Showing basic content

- delete all files in `public/` except index.html
- delete all files in `src/`
  - then create new file called `index.js`

`React` library:

- Library that defines what a component is and how multiple components work together

`ReactDom` library:

- Library that knows how to get a component to show up in the browser
- this is useful for getting React to display properly in web browser vs. phone
  - mobile --> ReactNative ...
